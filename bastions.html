        <h1>Bastions - Draft</h1>
<p>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re gonna do bastions.  Establishing a bastion is optional. If you want to keep the game simpler, then ignore all this. If you want to increase the complexity of the game, then read on. To truly follow along with all this, you are going to need a DMG to understand the rules for bastions. I am heavily modifying the rules for bastions from what is presented in the DMG. But even still, you will need access to those rules. The intent behind my modifications is to turn 5E bastions into somethign that resembles the old-school &quot;domain&quot; play. I want your bastion to have an important influence on the game, including how other players interact with the game.</p>
<p>The rules I propose below are much more expansive than I usually try to be. But since the default rules for bastions are not included in the player&#39;s handbook, I feel no obligation to play them RAW. You will notice there are certain aspects below that introduce the possibility for intra-party conflict. </p>
<h1 id="who-can-establish-a-bastion">Who can establish a bastion</h1>
<p>All classes except for barbarians may establish bastions. Bastions include the physical building of course, but also the hiring of various followers and hirelings. And I just don&#39;t see barbarians settling down like that.</p>
<h1 id="when-can-a-character-establish-a-bastion">When can a character establish a bastion</h1>
<p>A character can establish a bastion any time after attaining 5th level. Each character can only have one. Unlike the DMG, you do not just magically get a bastion when you hit 5th level. You will need to construct one from scratch, or claim an existing structure to be your bastion (more on this below).</p>
<h1 id="what-does-a-bastion-do">What does a bastion do</h1>
<p>A bastion will be composed of the normal facilities and special facilities like is described in the DMG. We will play out bastion turns as it suggests. I may add other bastion turn events to those given in the DMG.</p>
<p>The special facilities that exist in a bastion attract the hirelings as suggested by the DMG. I encourage you to create actual playable characters for these hirelings (of suitable background and class), but it is not required. Additionally, it is assumed that your bastion attracts dozens more followers that live in and around your bastion. These followers work the land and support you financially. You no longer need to pay lifestyle costs at the start of a session. With time, especially if the bastion owner continues to adventure, the number of followers that live under your protection may grow into the hundreds or even thousands.</p>

<p>Additionally, your bastion clears out the explored area surrounding it of wandering monsters. It does not remove monsters from other dungeons, temples, or lairs that might exist within your bastion&#39;s reach. The radius that your bastion clears out is given in the table above, and is based on the character&#39;s class. For example, if a fighter establishes a bastion, then all monsters within an 8 hex radius of the bastion are cleared out. This means all characters can safely travel within that radius without risk of encountering wandering monsters. This clearing radius is blocked by bodies of water (lakes and seas). This clearing away of monsters is a result of the bastion owner and his or her followers going on regular patrols to defeat any would-be monsters. It might also include posting the carcasses of slain monsters on stakes at the perimeter to ward off any other would be monsters.</p>
<p>If a character is multi-classed, then the radius of a bastion is based on the largest radius afforded to that character from all classes with at least 5 levels in them. So a Wizard 5 / Fighter 1 can have a bastion of radius 2 hex tiles. A Wizard 5 / Fighter 5 would have a radius of 8 tiles.</p>
<p>When you begin a game session, instead of starting from Last Haven, you can begin your adventure from any bastion, so long as you have permission from the player that owns that bastion. The player that owns the bastion can require you pay a toll or other fee to do this. If you start a game session, and you haven&#39;t received permission from that player, then you can&#39;t start from their bastion.</p>
<h1 id="how-can-a-bastion-be-established">How can a bastion be established</h1>
<p>A bastion can be established in one of two ways: from raw construction, or from routing an existing dungeon. In either case, your character must make a pilgrimage to the location during a session, either alone or with a party. You must take about 25 followers with you. You don&#39;t need to do anything to recruit them -- they are willing to follow you on account of your strength and bravery. These followers will bring with them the construction materials needed to build or convert your bastion. They feed themselves, but require protection during the pilgrimage. During this pilgrimage, you may only move at a slow pace. Once the caravan reaches the hex tile that you wish to claim as your bastion, and as long as you satisfy all the requirements (cost, distance to other bastions, no monsters around), then the area is claimed, and construction or conversion begins. </p>
<h2 id="raw-construction">Raw Construction</h2>
<p>You can build a stronghold out of raw materials. The cost to construct each room will follow the values in the DMG. To start, you must construct at least room for two special facilities. If you increase your level and earn access to more special facilities, then you must convert a basic facility, or construct more rooms for the new special facility. The construction is performed by your followers. The cost to hire them is included in the prices for building the rooms. Constructing multiple new rooms can be done in parallel. So the quickest and cheapest way to construct a new bastion costs 2000 gp, takes 45 days, and consists of two &quot;roomy&quot; special facilities. The character establishing the bastion can go out and adventure during this construction time as normal. </p>
<h2 id="routing-a-dungeon">Routing a Dungeon</h2>
<p>Instead of making a bastion out of nothing, you can convert a dungeon you find (an old keep, abandoned tower, ancient tomb, forgotten caves, etc.) in the wilds into your bastion. To do so, you must completely rout out the dungeon of any monsters that live within it. The dungeon must be completely explored too. There must be rooms to support two special facilities. If there aren&#39;t, then you will need to construct them like above. You still need to make a pilgrimage with your followers, but there is no time required to construct the bastion.</p>
<h1 id="where-can-a-bastion-be-established">Where can a bastion be established</h1>
<p>Where a bastion can be established is dependent on the radius of the new bastion. The bastion must be established within reach of another bastion or Last Haven. When completed, there should exist a safe path that can be traveled from Last Haven to the new Bastion. For example, if a fighter is to establish a bastion, then he or she must establish it within 8 tiles of Last Haven or another friendly Bastion.</p>
<p>If a character wants to establish a bastion within the radius of any existing bastions, then that character must receive permission from those bastions. </p>
<p>Characters (particularly rogues) can also establish their bastions in the same physical space as another character&#39;s bastion as per the DMG rules on combining bastions. Doing so require permission of the existing bastion&#39;s owners, and all other neighboring bastions like normal.</p>
<p>Finally, a bastion can not be established anywhere near a Keeper. No followers would dare follow you into a Keeper&#39;s territory. And a keeper would surely destroy any structure you build. </p>
