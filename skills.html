    <h2 class="display-6">Skill Proficiencies Ranked</h2>
    <p>You ever notice that some skills get used more than others? Almost like they&#39;re not all created equal. I did a modest perusing of the core rules while looking for explicit references to each of the skill proficiencies. Of course, a DM is able to improvise applications for each proficiency, but based solely on what the core rules explicitly says to use them for, here is how they stack up</p>
    <h3 id="-athletics">⭐⭐⭐⭐ Athletics</h3>
    <p>is used to break free from grapples, escape spells like black tentacles and ensnaring strike, and break down doors. It can also help you wrap someone up in chains, and to break free from being tied up in ropes. Since escaping a grapple is rarely worth your action in combat, those uses don&#39;t give this skill much value. Breaking down doors, and smashing open locked chests, however, is a wonderful thing to do. Since it covers so many things, this skill gets four stars.</p>
    <h3 id="-acrobatics">⭐⭐⭐ Acrobatics</h3>
    <p>is used to escape grapples, ropes, and chains; similarly to how athletics is used to bind someone up. It&#39;s used to resist falling in slippery areas like a sleet storm spell. You can catch ioun stones if you&#39;re lucky. And it helps you use a grappling hook. Not quite as versatile as athletics, so only 3 stars.</p>
    <h3 id="-sleight-of-hand">⭐⭐ Sleight of Hand</h3>
    <p>is used to pick locks, and tie knots in ropes. Both are tasks that are not actually (supposed to be) that difficult, so if you lack proficiency in this skill, you are probably ok. Furthermore, if you are a rogue, you probably can use your thieves&#39; tools proficiency for picking locks instead. Which means this skill is even less useful. Of course, you can probably imagine other uses for this one without me needing to mention it.</p>
    <h3 id="-stealth">⭐⭐ Stealth</h3>
    <p>Used to take the hide action. Typically you don&#39;t really see a ton of hiding in D&amp;D anymore, unless there is a rogue that is allowed to hide during, as opposed to before, combat (which they should not be allowed to). Did you know that the 2014 rules give stealth checks as an example of a good candidate for a group check, but the 2024 rules give it as a bad example? What&#39;s that about?</p>
    <h3 id="-arcana">⭐⭐⭐ Arcana</h3>
    <p>Allows for the scribing of scrolls, which means you can skip learning to use calligraphers tools. You can take the Study action to identify spells being cast (but if most spells only take an action to cast, then you probably won&#39;t be doing this unless you barge in on someone casting a ritual). Arguably from that, one should be able to identify spells that have been cast too, like arcane lock, or where a teleportation circle goes. With it, you can use scrolls that don&#39;t belong to you. Some magic items require its use. And it can be used to study some monsters.</p>
    <h3 id="-history">⭐ History</h3>
    <p>Used to take the Study action, so that you can remember ye olden days. Just terrible.</p>
    <h3 id="-investigation">⭐⭐ Investigation</h3>
    <p>Used to take the Study action. This one is often improperly used as an alternative to Perception. It&#39;s really meant to be used to figure out how traps work, or spend protracted hours in a library (now that&#39;s what I call sword and sorcery), or to notice that illusions are illusions.</p>
    <h3 id="-nature">⭐ Nature</h3>
    <p>Used to take the Study action so you can identify plants and animals, including plant type monsters.</p>
    <h3 id="-religion">⭐ Religion</h3>
    <p>Used to take the Study action. Almost as bad as History, but at least Religion clues you in to some monsters like Undead and Fiends.</p>
    <h3 id="a-sidenote-prediction-about-the-2024-monster-manual">A sidenote prediction about the 2024 Monster Manual</h3>
    <p>The 2024 rules give us the Study action which, among other things, can be used to draw up information on monsters. Two feats in the 2024 rules (Keen Mind and Observant) also allow you to use the Study and Search actions as bonus actions. This implies that those actions should be used in combat. I predict that the new monster manual will provide us with guidance for what kind of information player characters can learn from using these actions in combat. For example, take the study action to learn how many HP a monster has, or what resistances/vulnerabilities it has, etc. We&#39;ll see. I guess if it doesn&#39;t tell us to do that, then DMs will have to do it ourselves.</p>
    <h3 id="-animal-handling">⭐ Animal Handling</h3>
    <p>Lets you use the Influence action on animals. Sadly, doesn&#39;t do anything to help you ride or control a mount anymore. </p>
    <h3 id="-insight">⭐ Insight</h3>
    <p>Use it to take the search action to &quot;discern a creature&#39;s state of mind&quot;. Players often want to use this skill as a lie detector, but that doesn&#39;t jive with me. I feel it should only go so far as to clue you in to things like &quot;he seems stressed&quot;, or &quot;he looks uncomfortable&quot;. Oh, you can also use it to discern that a raven&#39;s mimicry ability is a trick.</p>
    <h3 id="-medicine">⭐ Medicine</h3>
    <p>Can be used to stabilize a dying creature. And can be used to take the Search action to detect a creature&#39;s ailment. Given that the DC for stabilization is only 10, I don&#39;t think you need to take proficiency here for that. And if someone is sick, maybe just ask them what&#39;s wrong? Oh, you were bit by a wolf, and now you&#39;re all hairy and irritable? Hmmmm...</p>
    <h3 id="-perception">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Perception</h3>
    <p>Find and explore absolutely everything. The grand daddy of them all. This skill blows all the others out of the water. If you could only have one. . . Looking for a secret door? perception. Worried about traps? Perception. Looking for where that halfing ran off to? perception. Listening to what&#39;s on the other side of that door? Investigation? NO! perception every time! Supposedly one third the game is exploration, and this skill covers most of that. Two thumbs up.</p>
    <h3 id="-survival">⭐⭐⭐ Survival</h3>
    <p>Use it to avoid getting lost, follow tracks, and forage for food and water. Pretty useful stuff if you are adventuring outside at all.</p>
    <h3 id="-deception">⭐⭐ Deception</h3>
    <p>Use it to take the Influence action. This works just like persuasion, but is predicated on you using a convincing lie to do it. </p>
    <h3 id="-intimidation">⭐⭐⭐ Intimidation</h3>
    <p>Use it to take the Influence action. Works just like persuasion, but you have to look tough while you do it. Well ok, you could also intimidate in other ways, like showing how highly ranked you are in the king&#39;s army or something like that. If you are trying to demoralize the orcs you are fighting into running away, this is probably your best bet. If you consider all of the different situations you might use the Influence action, you can probably think of how you could use Intimidation. For that reason, I rank Intimidation higher than all of the other charisma based skill proficiencies, because the others are more limited in their applications.</p>
    <h3 id="-performance">⭐⭐ Performance</h3>
    <p>Use it to take the Influence action. A little harder to imagine <em>how</em> to use this skill to Influence someone into <em>doing</em> something for you. Perhaps a rousing tune inspires your fans to follow you into battle, or a rousing fan-dance convinces the guard to hand over his key. Since proficiency in this skill covers all forms of performance you can get creative with it.</p>
    <h3 id="-persuasion">⭐⭐ Persuasion</h3>
    <p>Use it to take the Influence action. Basically, use this skill to convince a creature that it is in their best interest to do what you want, by asking them nicely, but you&#39;re not allowed to lie while you do it. </p>
