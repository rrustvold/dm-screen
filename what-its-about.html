    <h2 class="display-6">What's this Game Really About - <small>You don't need to read this section, but you may find it interesting</small></h2>
        <h3>All the little things</h3>
        <p>
            A big inspiration for this campaign is that I want to present a game of D&D as it is "meant" to be played, rather than how I typically run D&D, or how we see
            D&D presented in pop-culture. To do this, I've scoured the PHB and made notes out of all the little things the game includes, but often go overlooked by DMs and players. For example,
            if you read the PHB with a fresh mind, you will notice that many race and class features (including spells) provide protection or resistance to fear and charm effects.
            However, in most games, player characters are rarely subjected to such effects, likely because not very many monsters have them. The DMG doesn't talk about this, but based
            on how often the PHB talks about fear and charm effects, you would think it is a big part of the game. My conclusion is that it is up to me as the DM, to challenge your
            characters with fear and charm effects, even if monsters don't do it out of the book. This is just one example, but there are several others I've identified including:
            the importance of languages, the ability to communicate with animals, the existence of guilds and factions, the threat of poisons, regular encounters with undead and fiends,
            an abundance of outdoor adventuring, and a variety of difficult terrains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I started this project, the revised 2024 version of the PHB has been released, and the writers
            have actually seemed to address some of this, not by pointing out to DMs that you need to touch on these overlooked things, but by removing them. For example, in the 2014 rules, Paladins
            had the "Divine Sense" feature which implies that hidden fiends or undead are lurking around wherever you go. In 2024, the Paladin no longer has this feature, probably because it wasn't being
            used by players, because DMs were not designing for it. Nevertheless, it is still my intention to provide the crunchiest D&D that the game provides using only the core rules.
        </p>
        <h3>How to be good at D&D. Or, is D&D a hard game?</h3>
        <p>
            I've also done a lot of thinking about where the challenge for players in D&D comes from, and I've concluded that the game's challenge is in testing if the players have
            properly prepared their characters for the adventure they are embarking upon. In other words, each adventure or session asks, "Did you prepare for this?".
            Individual combat encounters are not intended to be tactical challenges that require a lot of strategy from the players. Rather, they are opportunities for playeres to flex their
            characters' abilities. Like when James Bond shows off the tricks Q built into the Bond car, it's purely for the gratification of the audience. Even the most complex characters don't offer that much
            variation in what can be done in a round of combat. Instead, all combat encounters taken in aggregate ask: do your characters have the right weapons, armor, and spells prepared to deal with this monster?
            Do they have enough resources to make it through all the encounters and traps in the dungeon? This can change from adventure to adventure. An adventure that involves a crypt filled
            with undead will be best tackled with clerics, paladins, protection from evil spells, and ample amounts of holy water. Whereas an adventure into a temple of elemental fire
            might be better prepared for with protection from energy spells and the ability to communicate in the "primordial" language. And an adventure that embarks into drow territory
            would be served well with plenty of antitoxin, resistance to poisons, proficiency with the elf language, and lesser restoration spells.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, obstacles, tricks, traps, and puzzles that you encounter in a dungeon are not meant to test your ability as a player to solve the puzzle. Rather, they are meant to test
            whether your characters are prepared. Have they brought the right adventuring gear (thieves tools, ten-foot poles, rope, crowbars, etc.)? Can they speak or read the right languages? Are they
            prepared to climb a cliff or cross a chasm? Did they bring enough food and water to travel all the way to where they are going? Do they have the means to carry back all the treasure they find?
        </p>
        <h3>What's the deal with combat?</h3>
        <p>
            A typical combat encounter in 5E typically takes anywhere from 20-90 minutes. The dungeon master's guide specifies that a typical party should encounter 6-8 combats in a
            single adventuring day. Most DMs find this to be a silly number to deal with, because they are trying to advance a story in between those combats. So DMs attempt to
            correct things by reducing the number of combats in a day, but making them "harder". Players then compensate against this by taking their turns very carefully (i.e. slowly).
            But as I mentioned before, there isn't much a player can do on their turn that is so tactically interesting, because the character only has so many things
            they could conceivably do. Melee characters are going to engage into melee. Ranged attackers are going to take cover if they can. Spell casters are going cast the spells
            they have prepared. So a "hard" combat encounter, is really just one in which the probability of "losing", as determined by the luck of the dice, is greater; it is not actually more challenging to the players,
            because the players have already sealed their fate before initiative is rolled in how they have created and prepared their characters. A "harder" combat also tends to be a longer encounter,
            because the monsters will have more HP, AC, and attacks, than an easier combat encounter. So trying to get around the 6-8 encounters per day backfires. Instead, we ought
            to play the game the way it was designed to be played, with lots of encounters per day.
        </p>
        <h3>The combat meta-challenge</h3>
        <p>
            With a West Marches type game like this, there is an additional meta-challenge: can you the player reach your goal before the session is up? Since there is no "save and continue" like
            a typical D&D campaign, this campaign style challenges you as a player to know what you are doing. If you can expect 6-8 encounters in a day, then that means you are going to have
            to deal with them quickly to reach your goal, and not spend 20-90 minutes on each one. To that end, we may not use a grid for combat, since that only slows things down more.
            I think I will leave that up to you, the players. I know some people really like to have one.
            Personally, I don't really care if you are slow to take your turns in combat (or anywhere else), as long as people are having a good time. But the meta-challenge from
            having limited time should inject some excitement and keep things lively. I don't want people to feel rushed, but aiming for 30-60 seconds per turn is probably where we want to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of the time in this game a player will not see
            a particularly interesting or useful action to take on their turn. So they hum and haw at their options, because they don't want to "waste" their turn. And if the encounter is a "deadly" one like
            I mentioned before, then the player has a good reason to be careful. In this campaign, you probably don't need to worry about it if you're just dealing with some orcs that are still out of your range.
            Just take the dodge action and let the next person go, because your next turn will come around quickly, and the stakes of the encounter are not so extreme. Furthermore, you may want to try and avoid combat,
            or solve it in other non-violent ways. Which is to say, are your characters prepared to sneak around monsters, or trick them, or parley with them?
            In all fairness though, I will also be using a system for monster morale behind the screen, so that your enemies might surrender or retreat before you finish routing them.
            After all, if the band of goblins is getting creamed after a round or two, they ought to see the writing on the wall and retreat.
        </p>
        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>
            The challenge in this game is to prepare your character appropriately for the adventure. Then play the game quickly and efficiently so that you get what you're trying to get: treasure, experience points, and the joy that comes from killing a big monster.
