# Introduction
This is an idea I had after analyzing equipment for 5E [here](/blog.html?post=equipment_state_machine)

In D&D, different weapons have always done different damage. And different classes have had different weapons available to them via proficiencies. These mechanics typically lead players toward a handful of dominant strategies regarding character builds.

For example, in 5E, Rogues typically find that dual-wielding a Shortsword and Scimitar is the dominant strategy that maximizes damage per turn. Fighters settle into either a similar dual-wielding stance, or use a combination of the Great Weapon Fighting feat alongside a Greatsword (2d6 damage), Maul (1d12 damage), or Greataxe (1d12).

A Fighter has little incentive to model their character after a classic soldier from antiquity wielding a shield and spear, because the Spear (1d6 damage when used with a shield) is a clearly inferior weapon choice to a Longsword (1d8). And a Longsword in two hands is clearly inferior to a Greatsword. Similarly, the choice of Polearms is not particularly attractive (1d10 damage), unless perhaps coupled with the Polearm Master feat at 4th level.

Two-Weapon Fighting builds (regardless of how implausible that would be in reality) are very common in 5E, and for good reason. You essentially get two attacks. Two attacks at 1d6 damage each have the same expected damage as a single attack at 2d6 damage. It’s clear the designers had this balance in mind when making 5E. The downside is that players who opt for a Two-Weapon Fighting build take longer on their turn, because they have to roll twice as many dice. Two-Weapon Fighting builds are just more complicated for no real reason.

Because of the search for dominant strategies, players tend to gravitate toward a subset of the weapons available. I’ve never seen a player use Clubs, Sickles, Whips, or Greatclubs in 5E. Even the Mace, a mainstay of the Cleric, is usually passed over in favor of a Quarterstaff or a superior Martial Weapon.

The system presented here rethinks weapon choices and the search for dominant strategies. I have not given this system a ton of thought. It's basically just a "bar napkin sketch". As such, the ideas presented here haven't really been "balanced" in any sort of way, and I'm sure there are things I'm neglecting. The goal though is to remove the tedium from managing equipment, de-couple weapon flavor from mechanics, but still leave an opportunity for strategic decisions.

# Fighting Stances

Rather than giving classes proficiency in particular weapons, characters have proficiency in **Fighting Stances**. The stances are:

1. Weapon and Shield
2. Weapon and Tool
3. Skirmisher
4. Great Weapon Fighting
5. Marksman
6. Archer
7. Thrown Weapon Fighting
8. Shield Bearer

The system does not assign properties, masteries, damage dice, weights, costs, or anything else to specific weapons. The actual weapon you wield in each stance is entirely flavor. When a character adopts a particular Fighting Stance, they receive various bonuses to their AC, attack bonus, damage, etc., depending on the stance.

A character is always in one stance. Once per turn, a character can change from one stance to any other for free.

If a character has Weapon Masteries available, then you choose one of the mastery properties that are available for a particular stance. You then apply that mastery property whenever you attack with that stance.

Any weapon(s) you attack with are purchased using the table below. Weapons are available in five classes. A class II weapon costs 10 GP to buy, and deals 1d6 damage, be it a dagger, long-sword, cross bow, or anything else.

A player needs to decide what their weapon and or shields actually are. You can't just buy a class III skirmisher outfit and not decide what your weapons are. 

Players can decide what damage type their weapons deal, as long as it makes sense (slashing for sword, piercing for spears).

| Weapon Class   | I     | II     | III        | IV      | V           |
| -------------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Cost           | 1 GP  | 10 GP  | 50 GP      | 100 GP  | 200 GP      |
| Damage         | 1d4   | 1d6    | 1d8 or 2d4 | 1d10    | 1d12 or 2d6 |
| Marksman Range | N/A   | 30/120 | 80/320     | 100/400 | 100/400     |
| Archer Range   | N/A   | 80/320 | 80/320     | 100/400 | 150/600     |
| Thrown Range   | 20/60 | 20/60  | 30/120     | 30/120  | 30/120      |

# Unarmed Strikes

For this system, an unarmed strike is a type of weapon. So you can combine a shield with your fists and adopt the Weapon and Shield stance without a literal weapon. Making an unarmed strike works the same as in the RAW 5E rules.

# Finesse

Rogues and Monks can use either Strength or Dexterity modifiers for all attack and damage rolls.
