    "The entrance lies near the bottom of an abandoned moss-covered well. In the well’s interior wall, fifteen feet down, muddy bricks protrude slightly in a spiral downward allowing agile characters to get the sixty feet to the bottom where a secret door grants entry to the dungeon. The bottom of the well is filled with a few inches of rainwater and a few feet of thick mud. Those who fall in ignore the first 10 feet of falling damage.",
    "A circle of magical runes large enough for an average wagon with a team of horses encloses images of clouds and birds painted onto the floor. A faint breeze of cold, fresh air blows from the circle. Speaking the correct command while in the circle causes the creature to disappear and reappear in the dungeon.",
    "A tumbled-down two-story tower of grey stone is perched upon a low mound in a foggy moor. Broken arrow shafts, rusty swords, and bleached bones poke through the soggy soil for hundreds of feet around the hill. Within, the tower is entirely empty but for a skeleton seated at a simple table, an empty bottle of wine before it, and a fine longbow at its side. An iron key that opens a nearby trapdoor hangs from a leather thong around the skeleton's neck.",
    "A worked tunnel protrudes the length of a spear into the side of the dirt mound, its entrance covered in moss and vines while a putrid sludge flows rapidly out onto the wet, muddy ground. The stonework is chipped and worn, suggesting it is very old. A scream, or possibly some strange bird call, echoes from deep within.",
    "The entrance is a broad hole located on the side of a steep cliff. A rickety wood and rope elevator, sized for six man-sized creatures, has been rigged to provide access. It may, or may not, be safe or it could even be sabotaged.",
    "The entrance is a set of stairs behind a locked portcullis below an abandoned arena. A statue of a phoenix is carved into the wall above the portcullis. The statue radiates faint magic, but does not hinder the PCs’ explorations.",
    "To prevent admission to the dungeon, the entrance is inside a traditional fortified keep, which is surrounded by a crenulated wall. A water-filled moat with a raised drawbridge surrounds the keep. From the outside, the keep seems abandoned.",
    "The entrance is at the end of a box canyon. Thirty feet across with walls more than sixty feet high, the approach is littered with boulders large enough for cover and a thick fog provides concealment. Two huge iron-bound doors of timber are ajar with the left door hanging solely by one hinge. Enemies could lurk anywhere...",
    "A crude, cracked brick roadway is disappearing beneath the sands and is only visible here and there. It leads to a natural cave in an outcropping of rock that stands out prominently in the desert. A primitive painting in white outside the cave depicts a stickman holding a spear and several four-legged creatures, each with a single horn and long tails.",
    "The entrance is behind a shelf of old, dusty books in a large library. It opens by pulling on the correct book.",
    "A line of square marble columns marches toward a grand archway. Above the entrance, a frieze depicts a bearded man lounging upon a stone while golden birds bring him bunches of grapes.",
    "A broad staircase of black stone rises to a door of iron, painted bright red and covered in dripping blue runes. The door pierces a wall of plain stone and radiates significant heat, requiring those that approach to risk nausea and fatigue.",
    "The entrance to the dungeon, a round door with a ship's wheel in the center, is in a grand hall with walls carved to depict stone ships sailing out of the walls towards the middle of the hall. The floor is of dark blue tiles and the room is strangely filled with the scent of sea air.",
    "A soaring narrow bridge crosses a grand chasm to a gate of golden bars. The bridge rises at a steep grade to the higher side, making it difficult to see what lies beyond the gate. On either side of the bridge are a pair of statues in the shape of winged lions; one stands rampant while the other has its mouth wide in a feral roar.",
    "Built into the side of a hill, a low moss-roofed cottage protrudes as far as a horse. A candle flickers beyond a clouded glass window, barely visible past the gnarled trees and thorny bushes. Sickly herbs grow in boxes under the windows. Rustling in the underbrush and the reflection of small eyes suggest the land is alive with fauna that are not at all disturbed by the PCs’ approach.",
    "Glowing blue lichen and large mushrooms line the cavern, growing out of the soft loamy soil. A pale white vine grows along the ground, through bones of small animals. Water drips from the ceiling like a slow steady rain, making conversation difficult.",
