        <h1 class="display-4">Campaign Concepts</h1>
        <p>
            Last Haven is a "west-marches" style 5E D&D campaign by Rian. We will use the new 2024 rules. I have a "master's" tier 
            subscription on D&D Beyond, so I can share the digital rules with up to 12 people. If you'd like access, let me know
            and I'll send you a code or something.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game will be fast paced, emphasize hex crawling wilderness exploration and dungeon delving, while being light on urban adventuring.
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-6">Open table</h2>
        <p>The campaign will run as an "open table", meaning that people can come and go as they please from session to session.
            There is no obligation to attend every game. I would also like to open up the floor for others to DM if they would like to.
        </p>
        <h2 class="display-6">A fresh start</h2>
        <p>Each session will start from the frontier town of Last Haven.
            From there, your characters will go out and do their thing: explore the wilderness, delve into dungeons, uncover secrets of the land, and kill monsters.
        </p>
        <h2 class="display-6">During the session</h2>
        <p>
            This is a by-the-books game, so you can expect 6-8 encounters per adventuring day. Since we will be using the "gritty realism"
            variant rule, you will likely not be long-resting during the game session. Your "adventuring day" is effectively the 
            game session. To get all of that combat, plus traps, puzzles, tricks, exploring, roleplaying, and everything else accomplished,
            you will have to act fast during the session.
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-6">What happens at the end</h2>
        <p>At the end of the session your characters are assumed to safely, and uneventfully, travel back to Last Haven.
            If your goal is to recover the lost staff from the third level of the Dread Knight's Tomb, then you'll have to act fast during the session.
            Otherwise, you'll have to start again from Last Haven next time, perhaps with different companions.
            Therefore, any game-time that you spend in analysis-paralysis is time that doesn't move you closer to the goal.
            This should also motivate you to be quick with combat -- know what you're going to do on your turn, and have your dice ready.
        </p>
        <h2 class="display-6">In between sessions</h2>
        <p>
            It's paramount that you prepare you character in advance of the game session.
        </p>
        <p>
           Here are some things you can or should do <i>before</i> each session:
            <ul>
            <li>create and level up your characters if applicable.</li>
            <li>adjust your prepared spells, weapon masteries, or other class features</li>
            <li>craft anything that your character is able to (using the new 2024 rules for that).</li>
            <li>purchase anything that is listed in the player's handbook for the price it's listed at (except for firearms which don't exist).</li>
            <li>sell anything listed in the PHB for half the listed value.</li>
            <li>exchange coins into any denomination, or convert into gems.</li>
            <li>decide which equipment you will take with you for the next adventure, and what equipment to leave safely behind</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
            You and the other players should discuss what you want to do during the next session:
            continue exploring the tomb from last time, follow the tattered map that was found, route out the bugbears from their camp along the mountain pass, etc...
            This way you can prepare your character for it (equipment, spells, etc.), and so I can prepare too.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we settle on when the next session will be, I will let you know how much game time will have passed since your character last ventured out.
            Depending on how long it has been, you should deduct your character's lifestyle cost from your gold stores.
            If your character was busy doing other "downtime activities", we will adjudicate the results of that at this point.
            All of this can be done before the next session starts.
            Your character and their equipment and spells should be ready to go when the game starts.

    </div>
    <div class="container p-5" id="section2">
        <h2 class="display-6">History</h2>
        <p>One thousand years ago the civilized races lived prosperously all across the land. The kingdoms, duchies, kingdoms, and clans of humans, elves,  and dwarves existed in a golden age. They traded freely and lived in peace with each other. Monstrous races such as hobgoblins and orcs threatened travelers occasionally, but posed little threat overall. Larger monsters, fiends, and aberrations, were known to exist, but mostly as legend.</p>

        <p>The people were united in their quests for divine knowledge and arcane power. The humans, dwarves, and elves each amassed great caches of wisdom and power in the twelve sacred temples. They sought to know God and reach him directly, and they nearly did, until the Keepers appeared.</p>
        <h2 class="display-6">The Keepers</h2>
        <p>Colossal monsters emerged from beneath the seas, above the clouds, and from underground. They decimated civilization and destroyed entire kingdoms. No one knows for sure where the gigantic beasts came from, or why. Most believe they were sent by God as a punishment for attempting to become so powerful. Others surmise that the creatures were accidentally unleashed as part of the powerful magic the ancient sages practiced.</p>

        <p>The orcs and goblinoids began to worship and serve the giant beasts. Through their evil service, these monstrous races inherited the land. And the civilized races retreated to the far corners of the world. The humans took to the south, and have taken refuge along a peninsula for generations now. Contact with the elves and dwarves was lost. None are sure if they even exist still (although small populations of dwarves, elves, and all the other civilized races exist among the humans).</p>
        <p>
            The attacks from the Keepers were so abrupt that much knowledge of the past was lost except to legend, passed down through oral tradition. Homes, villages, and entire cities
            were abandoned. For the last one thousand years they have either decayed into ruin, or been taken up by hobgoblins.
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-6">Present Day</h2>
        <p>
            The Killion kingdom (pop. ~10,000) now tends to humanity's meager refuge on the peninsula.
            To the north, various outposts, frontier towns, and military forts dot the landscape to protect against any monsters that might travel further south.
            Most conflict that threatens humanity comes from marauding bands of hobgoblins, gnolls, or orcs.
            Less often are attacks from Keepers -- gigantic beasts that roam the wilds leaving destruction in their wake.
            Fortunately, the Keepers are said to stay close to, and guard, the 12 ancient temples that once housed the divine works of the sages.
        </p>

        <p>
            Killion's armies guard the edges of the peninsula with the help of mercenaries and militia.
            Life within the kingdom is not good, and adventurers will risk journeying into the wild in search of lost riches from the ancient days.
            King Killion forbids adventurers from seeking out the 12 ancient temples.
            The given reason for this is that, since the Keepers came from the meddling in these temples, any further investigation will only anger the Keepers further.
            Rumors have spread that the real reason is that Killion wants to retrieve the treasures within the temples for himself, and that he sends out secret crusaders known as the "Night Guard" to do so.
        </p>
        <h2 class="display-6">Last Haven</h2>
        <p>The furthest town on the edge of the Killion kingdom is Last Haven. It  is surrounded by a twenty-foot tall bivouac to protect it from what evils might otherwise consume the fragile oasis.   From here, small parties of adventurers band together around common goals and set off into the wild in search of their quarries, whatever they may be.</p>

        <p>Some look to explore the mysterious ruins of past societies that pepper the landscape. Others hold out hope that perhaps beyond the expanses of monsters that lay before you are the lost bastions of other civilized races remembered only through legend. But most that set out from here are only interested in scoring a bounty of treasure to bring back home. Regardless of what compels you to leave the safety of home behind, you are sure to encounter a host of terrible monsters the moment you set foot outside Last Haven's walls.</p>
        <h2 class="display-6">People and Factions of Last Haven</h2>
        <p>Within Last Haven you can find most goods and services that adventurers need. Upon arriving it does not take long to discover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The New Moon Inn. Here you will find every kind of adventurer to accompany you in your quests, and a place to rest up between adventures.</li>
            <li>Poncho Leafwalker, a halfling and respected member of The Curators: a guild that deals in trade, messenger services, and maintaining trade routes. He can sell you most gear you may need. And if he doesn't have it in stock, he can surely source it for you.</li>
            <li>For magical and alchemical wares, you may be better off asking some of the patrons of the alchemical college known as The Society of the Tranquil Fire which holds a chapter here in Last Haven.</li>
            <li>The humble gnome Fravirbirt can assist you with any arms and armor at her workshop. She is a dues paying member to The Bronzeshapers -- a smithing guild.</li>
            <li>The Cartographers Club is a society of wealthy citizens interested in expanding their collection of maps and atlases of the continent, and of knowledge of the Keepers. Its members seldom adventure themselves, but are known to patronize others.</li>
            <li>The Scarlet Riders is a troupe of traveling performers who often visit Last Haven to provide entertainment, gambling, and other services.</li>
            <li>For religious practices, a small temple to Nouse has been constructed.</li>
            <li>Killion's army always has some soldiers stationed in Last Haven, but the town also organizes its own militia known as the Moon Guard to protect itself from outsiders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="display-6">Religion, Deities, and the Planes</h2>
        <img src="images/image1.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="height: auto; max-width: 90%" />
        <p>The civilized people of the Killion kingdom are largely monotheistic. They believe that Nouse is the creator of everything, and the ultimate divine entity. Other lesser divine beings (celestials, angels, archons, etc.)  exist in the higher planes. People oftentimes will pray to some of these lesser divine beings, as they are deities in their own way, but anyone who would pray or worship a lesser deity will ultimately revere Nouse. The most important divine beings beyond Nouse are the Twelve sages listed below. Clerics might realize their chosen domain by worshipping a corresponding sage; or they might revere Nouse and all twelve sages as a whole. Demons, devils, and other fiends exist in the lower planes. No one openly worships fiends, but warlocks may obtain their powers from them.</p>
        <p>
            <h3 class="display-6">The Twelve Sages and their Domains</h3>
            <ol class="w3-ol">
                <li>Adelard, the Human - Light</li>
                <li>Itu, the Human - War</li>
                <li>Argos, the Half-Orc - Life, War</li>
                <li>Lamlis, the Half-elf - Trickery</li>
                <li>Kala, the Elf - Light</li>
                <li>Bodil, the Elf - Trickery</li>
                <li>Eira, the Elf - Life</li>
                <li>Atl, the Elf - Trickery, War</li>
                <li>Ejiro, the Dwarf - War</li>
                <li>Oriel, the Dwarf - Light</li>
                <li>Hadarai, the Dwarf - Lift, Trickery</li>
                <li>Varis, the Dwarf - Life, Light</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Each of the twelve sages is said to have a lost temple somewhere out there. Each temple is said to be guarded by a Keeper, and houses untold divine and arcane power.
            </p>

        <!-- <p>The moon, sun, and stars revolve around the world. By climbing higher in altitude one can travel to the astral plane where the moon, planets, sun, stars, comets, etc. all float around in, and then higher still to reach the outer planes. The underworld is literally beneath your feet. It can be reached by digging deep enough such as through a dungeon. The elemental planes exist in tandem with the world. If you travel far enough you might wander into the plane of elemental fire, for example.</p> -->
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>
                The 2024 player's handbook canonizes a lot of D&D lore including religions, deities, and planes of existence.
                Especially in the section on species where they go on about how orcs come from "Gruumsh", and elves love "Correllon" or something.
                And most bizarrely of all, that humans come from a torus shaped planet called Sigil.
                If you want to use this lore in some way for your character, that is ok, but know that it will be considered as a pagan religion that no one takes seriously.
                Similarly to how people in our world don't consider ancient greek or norse gods to be real. You won't find any temples to these deities, or other civilized people who follow them.
                Not even the orcs that you encounter in the wild will believe in Gruumsh.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you play a "Path of the World Tree" Barbarian, then your belief in Yggdrasil is considered barbaric to civilized people. That is, you won't find any civilized folk from the Killion kingdom
                who believe in the World Tree.

            The following list should be consulted to create a new character.
            Beyond that, I provide justification for why I like these rules (if you aren't convinced).
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Characters can be created using only the 2024 player's handbook. No material from Xanathar's guide, Tasha's Cauldron, or any other source should be used</li>
            <li>See the section above on Religion and Deities if your character requires a deity, religion, or patron. Ignore any relgions, deities, or planes the PHB mentions</li>
            <li>You may make and play multiple characters. However, only one character should be played at a time during a session. If you maintain multiple characters, they should stay separate from each other. (i.e. no sharing or trading equipment between them)</li>
            <li>Characters will level up from experience points</li>
            <li>Characters start at level 1. This may change as the average character level increases.</li>
            <li>Ability scores should be determined using any of the methods given in the player's handbook. If you roll dice, be honest, and commit to the character that comes out of it for at least one session. Don't backpedal by thinking, "well I could have point-bought better scores so I'll just do that instead now".</li>
            <!-- <li>We will use the "variant encumbrance" rule from the 2014 player's handbook. As such, you must track the weight of all equipment, weapons, armor, and coins carried.</li> -->
            <li>You must track the weight of your carried equipment, armor, coins, etc. We will use the standard rules for this as written in the PHB which are very permissive. You likely won't need to worry about it much unless you have a very low strength,
                or happen to be carrying a lot of treasure around.
            </li>
            <li>You must track ammunition such as for bows or crossbows</li>
            <li>When traveling outside civilized areas you must track rations and water. When inside a civilized area, food and water needs will be met by your chosen "lifestyle"</li>
            <li>There are no firearms in my game. Please take a sharpie and cross out the guns from your player's handbook.</li>
            <li>We will use the "gritty realism" variant rule from the dungeon master's guide. With this rule, a short rest is 8 hours (or 4 hours for elves), and a long rest takes 7 days.</li>
        </ol>

                            Mostly the reason for limiting characters to the PHB is to make sure everyone understands everyone's characters, and that everyone is making characters of equal footing.
                            It can be hard for less experienced players, or players that don't have all the source books, or myself, to understand what the hell your tabaxi kensei-monk/hexblade-warlock even is, let alone what it does.
                            Secondly, my personal opinion is that it's straight up unnecessary to use supplementary sources to make fun characters.
                            If you are attracted to a supplemental race or subclass, it's either because of its flavor, or its mechanics.
                            If you like the flavor of something, then take inspiration from it, and build your character around that flavor using the PHB.
                            If you are attracted to the mechanics, then realize that it's all just the d20 system in the end, and that stuff doesn't really matter.
                            For example, if you are inspired by the Arcane Archer subclass, then consider making a fighter with the "eldritch knight" subclass and "archery" for a weapon style.

                            Consider that If arrows are consumable, then the mending spell can be used to repair broken arrows.
                            Proficiency with wood carvers' tools can be used to craft new arrows.
                            Arrows can be looted from enemies.
                            And the weight of arrows and quivers then plays into your character's encumbrance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If food, water, and encumbrance are tracked, then a good strength score is valuable to everyone, not just the melee inclined.
                            A bag of holding becomes a valuable magic item. You might choose to ride a mount which can carry your heavy equipment.
                            Or the party might use a cart to carry all its rations and other adventuring equipment thereby reducing each character's carried load.
                            This makes proficiency with land vehicles, and animal handling, valuable traits.
                            Characters that are good at foraging (e.g. rangers, druids)  get to be useful.
                            Spells such as "purify food and drink", "create or destroy water", and "create food and water"  become useful.
                        </p>

                        <p>In other words, these rules create additional challenges that can be solved creatively, and aren't just a bookkeeping problem. Nevertheless, nobody wants to waste precious game-time adjusting these things on the character sheets. Check out the "Players Guide to Last Haven" section for tips and tricks on how to manage these things efficiently.</p>

                        <p>With all of these rules (which are not house rules, these are the actual rules and always have been), you can see how there is a lot more to character creation than maximizing combat prowess. You should see that your skills and proficiencies with tools, crafting, foraging, and languages are an integral part of the game.</p>

                </div>

                            The variant rule for encumbrance was part of the 2014 rules, and it provides a little extra crunch to the game. In the 2024 rules,
                            this rule has been removed.
                            I suspect (i.e. hope) that it will re-appear in the 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide (where all the other variant rules appear) when it is released.
                            In any case, having good rules for carrying capacity is important for this campaign style, and the default rules for
                            carrying capacity are too permissive: even low strength characters can basically carry everything you could conceive of without penalty.
                            And I want you to have to make choices about what gear you take with you on an adventure, or at least, into a dungeon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this rule your character will most likely take a penalty to their speed. But this gives you an interesting decision to make for certain classes -- do I keep my ranger lightly armored and quick, or go with
                            heavier armor but accept the speed penalty?

                            During each game session you can expect 6-10 encounters (combat or otherwise) which is what the game is designed around. Since much of your
                            adventuring will take place outdoors while traveling, a few of these encounters will happen over the course of 
                            several game days, and the rest will likely take place inside a dungeon. Without the "gritty realsim" rule, 
                            we likely could not reach 6-10 encounters in a single game session. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A corrollory of this rule is that you will essentially not be able to long rest outside of Last Haven.
                            The odds of encountering at least one wandering monster over the course of seven days while out adventuring are essentially guaranteed.
                            This should jive really nicely with the new 2024 rules, since there are quite a lot of things that either refresh or that players can change about their characters after a long
                            rest (prepared spells, weapon masteries), and these are things best done at home and not at the game table.

            <h3>Maps and Traveling</h3>
            <p>
                A successful adventure starts with a good plan.
                Take a look at the map here. To the south is the Killion kingdom where you came from.
                To the north, east, and west are the unexplored wilds, overrun with monsters, ruins, dungeons, and who knows what else.
                Hobgoblins are known to come from the northwest, and wandering bands of orcs are said to be found to the east.
            </p>
            <img src="images/image3.png" class="float-end rounded m-2" style="max-width: 400px; width:100%;" />
            <p>
                Each hexagon on this map is 6 miles wide. This means, depending on your travel pace, you should cover 3-6 tiles in a day.
                This can depend on the terrain. Traveling across mountain peaks or murky swamps will naturally slow you down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before setting off, your party should select one or more members to act as a navigator to ensure you don't get lost.
                If they have a map, then this gets easier, obviously.
                You can do your future selves a big favor by having another party member with cartographers tools create maps as you travel.
                Foragers can look for food and water.
                And anyone else should keep their eyes and ears open for dangers ahead, or behind.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-info" style="overflow: hidden">
                <p>
                    A character can only do one thing at a time, so the navigator cannot also contribute their perception to being a look-out, for example.
                </p>
            </div>
             <p>
                Of course, if you're traveling along a road, river, or coastline, then there's no chance of becoming lost.
                 And creating useful maps requires a good set of Cartographers tools. Be sure to buy a set if you plan on mapmaking.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-info" style="overflow: hidden">
                <p>Traveling into an adjacent hex tile will require a character in the party to succeed on a Wisdom (survival) check to avoid becoming lost. If you become lost, then you spend the next 1d6 hours of your traveling day stuck in your current tile. If you have a map of the area, then the navigator gains +5 on this check. If you move at a "slow" pace, the navigator gains a advantage on the check. A fast pace incurs disadvantage. These checks are not very difficult individually, but you will have to make quite a lot of them.</p>
                <p>When you enter a new tile, I will reveal all the adjacent tiles to it (weather permitting) so that you can see what terrain lies ahead. If you are on top of hills, then I will reveal two tiles out, or three tiles out from the tops of mountains. This won't necessarily reveal everything that exists inside those tiles, but you will at least be able to see the terrain.</p>
                <p>A character with cartographers tools needs to make the DC 15 wisdom check per the players handbook in order to contribute that hex to the map. If you fail, then you need to spend an extra hour inside the tile to try the check again.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Camping</h3>
            <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DD-party-camp.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" />
            <p>At the end of the day, you'll need to set up camp. Hope you brought a tent.</p>

             <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>If you've played this game before, you are probably familiar with this conversation:</p>

                <p>"I'll take the first watch for two hours, then I'll wake up the dwarf for the next two-hour shift. By then, the elf should be finished meditating so he can take the next four hours..."</p>

                <p>To avoid wasting time on this every god-damn session, here's how I'm gonna do the "camping" problem.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I will roll to see if something goes bump in the night, if it does...</li>
                    <li>The whole party will make a group Wisdom (perception) check.</li>
                    <li>Elves get advantage on this because they don't sleep</li>
                    <li>Characters without darkvision roll with disadvantage cause it's dark at night</li>
                    <li>I will then roll to see which character was keeping watch when the encounter happens.</li>
                    <li>Depending on the nature of the encounter, the monster's stealth roll, the party's perception roll, then I will adjudicate what happens.</li>
                    <li>Only the character that was keeping watch at the time can be wearing armor. Everyone else wakes up in their jammies.</li>

            <!-- <h2 class="display-6">Dungeon Delving - as presented by Lidda of the Scarlet Riders</h2>
            <img src="images/image4.jpg" class="rounded m-2 float-end" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%"/>
            <p>
                Before I joined the ranks of the Scarlet Riders, I used to try and strike it rich by exploring the dungeons out there in the wilds.
                Dungeons take all kinds of forms out there: crypts, tombs, ancient ruins, abandoned keeps, haunted monasteries, shrines and temples.
                In my experience, dungeons are always filled with treasure, monsters, and traps. High risk, high reward.
                Sometimes you'll find a dungeon by pure happenstance, but other times you'll know a little something about the dungeon before going in.
                If you have some prior knowledge, then use it to your advantage.
                If you're going into an old tomb, then you should make friends with a cleric, for example.
                Or if a cave system is filled with poisonous fungi and spores, you should bring along a few antitoxins.
                This might seem obvious, but you'd be surprised how many foolhardy adventurers just go wandering off without a clue.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before heading into a dungeon, I recommend setting up camp nearby. You don't want to be weighed down with a bunch of camping gear while you're inside.
                That way, if you need to high-tail it out of there, you'll be able to outrun slower creatures.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the time it's pretty damn dark in a dungeon. Find someone with a free hand to hold a torch or lantern.
                Magical sources of light are even better. If everyone has their hands full already, then someone might have to stow a sword to carry the torch.
                If a battle breaks out, don't panic. Toss the torch into the room, or set down the lantern and get ready to fight.
            </p>

            <p>
                Don't think you have to destroy every creature you come across in a dungeon.
                Although nearly everything I've ever encountered in a dungeon is dangerous, not everything is necessarily evil.
                Some denizens are simply animals or other mindless things looking for their next meal.
                Other times, more intelligent creatures can be bribed, tricked, or negotiated with.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>I will award experience points if you overcome monsters in nonviolent ways such as through parleying, intimidation, tricking, sneaking past, etc. Experience points will also be awarded for disarming, bypassing, or falling victim to traps.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                If you think you'll ever need to return to the dungeon, someone in the party should create an accurate map while you explore.
                They will need a set of cartographers tools to produce a useful map.
                Don't forget to jot down some notes about what you find along the way.
                Between the time it takes to explore a room, quietly navigate corridors, search for traps, and draw maps, you should budget about 5-10 minutes per room.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>I will draw out the dungeon's map for you  as you explore it, but unless your character has cartographers tools, then you won't be able to keep the map after the session is finished -- just as with the outdoor maps.</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                You might need to rest inside the dungeon. Find a quiet spot to hole up for a little while, and hope nothing comes wandering by.
                If you absolutely need to sleep, I recommend heading back up to your campsite. Of course, that's not without its risks. By the time you go back inside the next morning, the dungeon's monsters may have regrouped or reset their traps.
                Furthermore, the dungeons inhabitants will likely try to ambush you in your sleep. My advice is to commit yourself to the dungeon in one fell swoop. Then get out of there and don't look back.
                Depending on the size and sparseness of the dungeon, you might just be able to sleep within it, but I wouldn't count on it.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>
                    I really want to discourage the practice of "long resting" after every encounter. That means the critters inside a dungeon are going to fight back and defend themselves against the intruders (you). They're not just 
                    going to let you take time-outs when it is convenient. Taking short rests will be easier, as the game is designed around the idea of you taking several short rests in a day.

            <a class="anchor" id="keeper"></a>
            <h2 class="display-6">The Keepers - as presented by Alred of the Cartographer's Club</h2>
            <img src="https://www.gmbinder.com/images/qoSSATc.jpg" class="rounded m-2 float-start" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%" />
            <p>
                Beyond the walls of Last Haven roam horrific monstrosities like you've never seen. Of course, I speak of the Keepers.
                Keepers roam the wilds attacking anyone they cross paths with. Our research has gathered that there are
                two such Keepers near Last Haven. To the east is a colossal spider we've named Gomo. She stands at least fifty feet tall, and her legs are as thick as tree trunks.
                And to the north, adventurers have crossed paths with Azitox the great Roc.
                Each Keeper is escorted by an army of smaller monsters. You'll know you are getting close to Gomo if you start to notice hoards of spiders around you.
                Likewise, Azitox is preceded by swarms of ravens, vultures, and eagles.
                The monsters you encounter will grow larger and more deadly the closer you get to the Keeper.
                My advice to you would be to keep an eye out for signs of a Keeper and take caution before it's too late.
                If you venture too deep into a Keeper's path, you may not make it out alive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The legends say that each of the twelve forbidden temples were claimed by a Keeper. And so although keepers are known to wander the wilds, we believe they stay reasonably close to their temples.
            </p>
            <p>
                The monstrous races all worship the Keepers -- it's the only way they can survive out in the wilds.
                The hobgoblins to the north worship Azitox, the great Roc. And the orcs to the east serve Gomo.
