        <h1>Campaign Concepts</h1>
        <p>
            Last Haven is a "west-marches" style 5E D&D campaign DM-ed by Rian. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The game will emphasize hex crawling wilderness exploration, and dungeon delving, while being light on narrative or urban adventuring.
            There will be recurring NPCs, villains, plot hooks, and continuity, but you should feel free to steer the campaign in whichever direction you like.
        </p>
        <h2>Open table</h2>
        <p>The campaign will run as an "open table", meaning that people can come and go as they please from session to session.
            There is no obligation, or pressure, to attend every game.
        </p>
        <h2>A fresh start</h2>
        <p>Each session will start from the frontier town of Last Haven.
            From there, your characters will go out and do their thing: explore the wilderness, delve into dungeons, uncover secrets of the land, and kill monsters.
        </p>

        <h2>What happens at the end</h2>
        <p>At the end of the session your characters are assumed to safely, and uneventfully, travel back to Last Haven.
            This means that if your goal is to recover the lost staff from the third level of the Dread Knight's Tomb, then you'll have to act fast during the session.
            Otherwise, you'll have to start again from Last Haven next time, perhaps with different companions.
            Therefore, any game-time that you spend in analysis-paralysis is time that doesn't move you closer to the goal.
            This should also motivate you to be quick with combat -- know what you're going to do on your turn, and have your dice ready.
        </p>

        <h2>In between sessions</h2>

        <p>
            You can level up your character if applicable.
            You can also purchase anything that is listed in the player's handbook for the price it's listed at.
            You can sell anything listed in the PHB for half the listed value.
            You can exchange coins into any denomination, or convert into gems.
            Feel free to peruse the dungeon masters guide for magic items. If there is something in there that you want to buy, let me know, I will probably say yes and quote you a price.
        </p>
        <p>
            You and the other players should discuss what you want to do during the next session. This way you can prepare your character for it (equipment, spells, etc.), and so I can prepare too.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will let you know how much game time will have passed since your character last ventured out.
            Depending on how long it has been, you should deduct your character's lifestyle cost from your gold stores.
            If your character was busy doing other "downtime activities", we will adjudicate the results of that at this point.
            All of this can be done before the session starts.
            Your character and their equipment and spells should be ready to go when the game starts.
        </p>
        <p>
            In between and before sessions, players should discuss what their characters are interested in doing for next time:
            continue exploring the tomb from last time, follow the tattered map that was found, route out the bugbears from their camp along the mountain pass, etc..
            This gives me a chance to prepare, and also a chance for you to prepare your character offline (spells, equipment, etc.)
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="container p-2 my-2 border" id="section2">
        <h2>Pre-history</h2>
        <p>Eons ago the civilized races lived prosperously all across the land. The kingdoms, duchies, empires, and clans of humans, elves,  and dwarves existed in a golden age. They traded freely and lived in peace with each other. Monstrous races such as hobgoblins and orcs threatened travelers occasionally, but posed little threat overall. Larger monsters, fiends, and aberrations, were known to exist, but mostly as legend.</p>

        <p>The people were united in their quests for divine knowledge and arcane power. The humans, dwarves, and elves each amassed great caches of wisdom and power in their sacred temples. They sought to know God and reach him directly, and they nearly did, until the Kaiju appeared.</p>
        <h2>The Kaiju</h2>
        <p>Colossal monsters emerged from beneath the seas, above the clouds, and from underground. They decimated civilization and destroyed entire kingdoms. No one knows for sure where the gigantic beasts came from, or why. Most believe they were sent by God as a punishment for attempting to become so powerful. Others surmise that the creatures were accidentally unleashed as part of the powerful magic the ancient sages practiced.</p>

        <p>The orcs and goblinoids began to worship and serve the giant beasts. Through their evil service these monstrous races inherited the land. And the civilized races retreated to the far corners of the world. The humans took to the South, and have taken refuge along a peninsula for generations now. Contact with the elves and dwarves was lost. None are sure if they even exist still (although small populations of dwarves, elves, and all the other civilized races exist among the humans).</p>
        <h2>Present Day</h2>
        <p>The Killion empire now tends to humanity's meager refuge on the peninsula. To the north, various outposts, frontier towns, and military forts dot the landscape to protect against any monsters that might travel further south. Most conflict that threatens humanity comes from marauding bands of hobgoblins, gnolls, or orcs. Less often are attacks from minor kaiju: gigantic beasts that roam the land leaving destruction in their wake. Fortunately, the major kaiju, the largest monstrosities of all, stay close to, and guard, the 12 ancient temples that once housed the work of the sages.</p>

        <p>Killion's armies guard the edges of the peninsula with the help of mercenaries and militia. Prisoners and outcasts are exiled to the frontier towns and forced to defend them. Life within the empire is not good, and adventurers risk journeying into the wild in search of lost riches from the ancient days. Those that take up such a calling are forbidden, by order of Emperor Killion, from seeking out the 12 ancient temples. The given reason for this is that the kaiju came from the meddling in these temples, and any further investigation will only anger the kaiju further. Rumors have spread that the real reason is that Killion wants to retrieve the treasures within the temples for himself, and that he sends out secret crusaders known as the "Night Guard" to do so.</p>
        <h2>Last Haven</h2>
        <p>The furthest town on the edge of the Killion Empire is Last Haven. It  is surrounded by a twenty-foot tall bivouac to protect it from what evils might otherwise consume the fragile oasis.   From here, small parties of adventurers band together around common goals and set off into the wild in search of their quarries, whatever they may be.</p>

        <p>Some look to explore the mysterious ruins of past societies that pepper the landscape. Others hold out hope that perhaps beyond the expanses of monsters that lay before you are the lost bastions of other civilized races remembered only through legend. But most that set out from here are only interested in scoring a bounty of treasure to bring back home. Regardless of what compels you to leave the safety of home behind, you are sure to encounter a host of terrible monsters the moment you set foot outside Haven's walls.</p>
        <h2>People and Factions of Last Haven</h2>
        <p>Within Last Haven you can find most goods and services that adventurers need. Upon arriving it does not take long to discover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The New Moon Inn. Here you will find every kind of adventurer to accompany you in your quests, and a place to rest up between adventures.</li>
            <li>Poncho Leafwalker, a halfling and respected member of The Curators: a guild that deals in trade, messenger services, and maintaining trade routes. He can sell you most gear you may need. And if he doesn't have it in stock, he can surely source it for you.</li>
            <li>For magical and alchemical wares, you may be better off asking some of the patrons of the alchemical college known as The Society of the Tranquil Fire which holds a chapter here in Last Haven.</li>
            <li>The humble gnome Fravirbirt can assist you with any arms and armor at her workshop. She is a dues paying member to The Bronzeshapers -- a smith guild.</li>
            <li>The cartographers club is a society of wealthy citizens interested in expanding their collection of maps and atlases of the continent. Its members seldom adventure themselves, but are known to patronize others.</li>
            <li>The Scarlet Riders is a troupe of traveling performers who often visit Last Haven to provide entertainment, gambling, and other services.</li>
            <li>For religious practices, a small temple to Nouse has been constructed.</li>
            <li>Killion's army always has some soldiers stationed in Last Haven, but the town also organizes its own militia known as the Moon Guard to protect itself from outsiders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Religion, Deities, and the Planes</h2>
        <img src="images/image1.jpg" class="rounded img-fluid"  />
        <p>The civilized people of the Killion empire are largely monotheistic. They believe that Nouse is the creator of everything, and the ultimate divine entity. Other lesser divine beings (celestials, angels, archons, etc.)  exist in the higher planes. People oftentimes will pray to some of these lesser divine beings, as they are deities in their own way, but anyone who would pray or worship a lesser deity will ultimately revere Nouse. Demons, devils, and other fiends exist in the lower planes. No one openly worships fiends, but warlocks may obtain their powers from them.</p>

        <p>The moon, sun, and stars revolve around the world. By climbing higher in altitude one can travel to the astral plane where the moon, planets, sun, stars, comets, etc. all float around in, and then higher still to reach the outer planes. The underworld is literally beneath your feet. It can be reached by digging deep enough such as through a dungeon. The elemental planes exist in tandem with the world. If you travel far enough you might wander into the plane of elemental fire, for example.</p>

    <div class="container p-2 my-2 border">
        <p>
            The following list should be consulted to create a new character.
            Beyond that, I provide justification for why I like these rules (if you aren't convinced).
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Characters can be created using only the player's handbook. No material from Xanathar's guide, Tasha's Cauldron, or any other source should be used</li>
            <li>You may multiclass and take feats</li>
            <li>See the section above on Religion and Deities if your character requires a deity, religion, or patron.</li>
            <li>You may make and play multiple characters. However, only one character should be played at a time during a se<>sion. If you maintain multiple characters, they should stay separate from each other. (i.e. no sharing or trading equipment between them)</li>
            <li>Characters will level up from experience points</li>
            <li>Characters start at level 1. This may change as the average character level increases.</li>
            <li>Ability scores should be determined using any of the methods given in the player's handbook. If you roll dice, be honest, and commit to the character that comes out of it for at least one session. Don't backpedal by thinking, "well I could have point-bought better scores so I'll just do that instead now".</li>
            <li>We will use the "variant encumbrance" rule. As such, you must track the weight of all equipment, weapons, armor, and coins carried.</li>
            <li>You must track ammunition such as for bows or crossbows</li>
            <li>When traveling outside of civilized areas you must track rations and water. When inside a civilized area, food and water needs will be met by your chosen "lifestyle"</li>
        </ol>

                </div>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>
                            Mostly the reason for limiting characters to the PHB is to make sure everyone understands everyone's characters, and that everyone is making characters of equal footing.
                            It can be hard for less experienced players, or players that don't have all the source books, or myself, to understand what the hell your tabaxi kensei-monk/hexblade-warlock even is, let alone what it does.
                            Secondly, my personal opinion is that it's straight up unnecessary to use supplementary sources to make fun characters.
                            If you are attracted to a supplemental race or subclass, it's either because of its flavor, or its mechanics.
                            If you like the flavor of something, then take inspiration from it, and build your character around that flavor using the PHB.
                            If you are attracted to the mechanics, then realize that it's all just the d20 system in the end, and that stuff doesn't really matter.
                            For example, if you are inspired by the Arcane Archer subclass, then consider making a fighter with the "eldritch knight" subclass and "archery" for a weapon style.

                        <p>Tracking those resources does create an organizational challenge for the player, but those rules enable characters to be more interesting by adding utility to often overlooked character features.</p>

                        <p>Consider that If arrows are consumable, then the mending spell can be used to repair broken arrows. Proficiency with wood carvers' tools can be used to craft new arrows. Arrows can be looted from enemies. And the weight of arrows and quivers then plays into your character's encumbrance.</p>

                        <p>If food, water, and encumbrance are tracked, then a good strength score is valuable to everyone, not just the melee inclined. A bag of holding becomes a valuable magic item. You might choose to ride a mount which can carry your heavy equipment. Or the party might use a cart to carry all its rations and other adventuring equipment thereby reducing each character's carried load.  This makes proficiency with land vehicles, and animal handling, valuable traits. Characters that are good at foraging (e.g. rangers, druids)  get to be useful. Spells such as "purify food and drink", "create or destroy water", and "create food and water"  become useful.</p>

                        <p>In other words, these rules create additional challenges that can be solved creatively, and aren't just a bookkeeping problem. Nevertheless, nobody wants to waste precious game-time adjusting these things on the character sheets. Check out the "Players Guide to Last Haven" section for tips and tricks on how to manage these things efficiently.</p>

                        <p>With all of these rules (which are not house rules, these are the actual rules and always have been), you can see how there is a lot more to character creation than maximizing combat prowess. You should see that your skills and proficiencies with tools, crafting, foraging, and languages are an integral part of the game.</p>

        </div>

            <h2>Wilderness Survival <small>- as presented by Krusk the half-orc ranger</small></h2>
            <img src="images/image5.jpg" class="rounded float-start m-2" style="width: 400px" />
            <h3>Food and Water</h3>
            <p>If you're going into the wild, you'll need to be prepared. I'm sure you have your weapons and armor polished and ready, but there's more to it than that! You're going to need to bring along enough food and water for your journey. You'll need one pound of food, and one gallon of water each day. Plan how long your party is going to be gone for, and buy the necessary rations.</p>

            <p>Water is heavy though, and you probably won't be able to carry more than a few gallons with you at a time. If you're traveling without any carts or wagons, you'll need to stay close to rivers and lakes so that you can fill your waterskins as needed. Fortunately there are plenty of fresh drinking sources near Last Haven. But to travel beyond, you'll likely want to invest in a cart and stock to pull it with. The value of a cart is twofold. First, your whole party can load all of their rations and camping gear into the cart. This will keep you unencumbered while traveling. Secondly, you can take along one or two barrels filled with fresh drinking water. Then you won't be tethered to rivers and streams. As you travel you'll find plenty of opportunities to keep those barrels topped off: from streams, creaks, springs, and even rainwater.</p>

            <p>Of course, if you or someone else in the party can forage for food and water, then that can lessen the amount you'll need to carry. But relying on foraging alone can be a gamble. Depending on the terrain, and the time of year, you might not always come up with enough food and water for everyone. Druids are known to magically produce a thing called a "goodberry" that they insist constitutes a good meal. Sure, it will keep you from starving to death, but it's a meager way to travel. And you still need water at the end of the day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Maps and Traveling</h3>
            <p>Now, to plan for your journey ahead, take a look at the map here. To the south is the Killion empire where you came from. To the north, east, and west are the unexplored wilds, teaming with monsters, ruins, dungeons, and who knows what else. Hobgoblins are known to come from the northwest, and wandering bands of orcs are said to be found to the east.</p>
            <img src="images/image3.png" class="mx-auto d-block rounded m-2" style="width: 400px" />
            <p>Each hexagon on this map is 6 miles wide. This means, depending on your travel pace, you can cover 3-6 tiles in one day. This can depend on the terrain. Traveling across mountain peaks or murky swamps will naturally take longer than open planes.</p>

            <p>Before setting off, your party should elect one or more members to act as navigator to ensure you don't get lost. If they have a map, then this task gets easier. You can do your future selves a big favor by having another party member with cartographers tools create maps as you travel. Foragers can look for food and water. And anyone else should keep their eyes and ears open for dangers ahead, or behind.</p>

            <p>Of course, if you're traveling along a road, river, or coastline, then there's no chance of becoming lost. And creating useful maps requires a good set of Cartographers tools. Be sure to buy a set if you plan on mapmaking.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>Traveling into an adjacent hex tile will require a character in the party to succeed on a Wisdom (survival) check to avoid becoming lost. If you become lost, then you spend the next 1d6 hours of your traveling day stuck in your current tile. If you have a map of the area, then the navigator gains advantage on this check. If you move at a "slow" pace, the navigator gains a +5 on the check. A fast pace incurs a -5 penalty. These checks are not very difficult individually, but you will have to make quite a lot of them.</p>


                <p>When you enter a new tile, I will reveal all of the adjacent tiles to it (weather permitting) so that you can see what terrain lies ahead. If you are on top of hills, then I will reveal two tiles out, or three tiles out from the tops of mountains. This won't necessarily reveal everything that exists inside those tiles, but you will at least be able to see the terrain.</p>
            </div>
            <p>If you don't have any mounts or vehicles to carry your gear while you travel, you will likely be encumbered. This is no problem in terms of the distance you can cover in a day, but it may leave you vulnerable to attacks from monsters or wild animals. The hobgoblins and orcs out there are good with a bow, and a slow moving target is easy pickings for them. Moving stealthily is one way to cover your tracks and avoid enemies.

            <h3>Camping</h3>
            <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DD-party-camp.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2" />
            <p>At the end of the day, you'll need to set up camp. I hope you brought a blanket or bedroll to sleep on, or I wouldn't count on being able to get a good rest. I also recommend bringing tents, or at least some canvas that you can use to shelter yourself from the rain and wind. Without it, all it takes is a little bad weather, and you won't be sleeping through the night.</p>

            <p>People ask me, "Krusk, do you ever sleep in armor so that you're ready to fight"? The answer is "No"! I never met anyone who could sleep in armor. I did travel once with a gnome that was known to pass out from ale while wearing his armor, but he didn't wake up the next day rested or refreshed.</p>

            <p>Figure out a routine for keeping watch while the party sleeps. There's all kinds of deadly things that can interrupt your sleep.</p>

             <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>If you've played this game before, you are probably familiar with this conversation:</p>

                <p>"I'll take the first watch for two hours, then I'll wake up the dwarf for the next two hour shift. By then, the elf should be finished meditating so he can take the next four hours..."</p>

                <p>To avoid wasting time on this every god-damn session, here's how I'm gonna do the "camping" problem.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I will roll to see if something goes bump in the night, if it does...</li>
                    <li>The whole party will make a group Wisdom (perception) check.</li>
                    <li>Elves get advantage on this because they don't sleep</li>
                    <li>Characters without darkvision roll with disadvantage cause it's dark at night</li>
                    <li>I will then roll to see which character was keeping watch when the encounter happens.</li>
                    <li>Depending on the nature of the encounter, the monster's stealth roll, the party's perception roll, then I will adjudicate what happens.</li>
                    <li>Only the character that was keeping watch at the time can be wearing armor. Everyone else wakes up in their jammies. (Remember that we are not using Xanathar's Guide, so its rules about sleeping in armor are not being used here.</li>
                </ol>

        <h2>Dungeon Delving - as presented by Lidda, the halfling rogue</h2>
        <img src="images/image4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded m-2 float-end" style="width: 400px"/>
        <p>Dungeons take all kinds of forms out there: crypts, tombs, ancient ruins, abandoned keeps, haunted monasteries, shrines and temples. In my experience dungeons are always filled with treasure, monsters, and traps. High risk, high reward. Sometimes you'll find a dungeon by pure happenstance, but other times you'll know a little something about the dungeon before going in. If you have some prior knowledge, then use it to your advantage. If you're going into an old tomb, then you should make friends with a cleric, for example. Or if a cave system is filled with poisonous fungi and spores, you should bring along a few antitoxins.</p>

        <p>Before heading in, I recommend setting up camp nearby. You don't want to be weighed down with a bunch of camping gear while you're inside. That way, if you need to high-tail it out of there, you'll be able to outrun slower creatures.</p>

        <p>Decide a marching order, and a standard operating procedure. Your party should be prepared for danger at the front, and from the back. You never know what kinds of traps or denizens might be crawling around. Keep your weapons and shields at the ready. Take a good listen at each door, and check for signs of traps before barging in. Maybe relegate any barbarians to the back of your ranks -- they love to come crashing through doors and waking up the whole dungeon. Once inside, give each room a thorough search if you can.</p>

        <p>Most of the time it's pretty damn dark in a dungeon. Find someone with a free hand to hold a torch or lantern. Magical sources of light are even better. If everyone has their hands full already, then someone might have to stow a sword to carry the torch. If a battle breaks out, don't panic. Toss the torch into the room, or set down the lantern and get ready to fight.</p>

        <p>Don't think you have to destroy every creature you come across in a dungeon. Although nearly everything I've ever encountered in a dungeon is dangerous, not everything is necessarily evil. Some denizens are simply animals or other mindless things looking for their next meal. Other times, more intelligent creatures can be bribed, tricked, or negotiated with.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p>I will award experience points if you overcome monsters in nonviolent ways such as through parleying, intimidation,  tricking, sneaking past, etc. Experience points will also be awarded for disarming, bypassing, or falling victim to traps.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If you think you'll ever need to return to the dungeon, someone in the party should create an accurate map while you explore. They will need a set of cartographers tools to produce a useful map. Don't forget to jot down some notes about what you find along the way. Between the time it takes to explore a room, quietly navigate corridors, search for traps, and draw maps, you should budget about 5-10 minutes per room.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p>I will draw out the dungeon's map for you  as you explore it, but unless your character has cartographers tools, then you won't be able to keep the map after the session is finished -- just as with the outdoor maps.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You might need to rest inside the dungeon. Find a quiet spot to hole up for a little while, and hope nothing comes wandering by. If you need to sleep, I recommend heading back up to your campsite. Depending on the size and sparseness of the dungeon, you might be able to sleep within, but I wouldn't count on it.</p>
